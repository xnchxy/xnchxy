## About Me

I am a post-doctoral fellow in the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore, working with Prof. [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). I got my Ph.D. degree in the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021, under the supervision of Prof. [Ya-xiang Yuan](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx/). I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Fudan University in 2016.

## Research Interests

- **Nonsmooth optimization** 
- **Riemannian optimization** 
- **Constrained optimization**

My research interests include numerical methods for nonsmooth optimization problems, especially in developing efficient stochastic subgradient methods with convergence guarantees. I am also interested in developing efficient algorithms for optimization problem with constraints. An important aspect of my work involves developing frameworks for direct implementations of unconstrained optimization approaches for solving constrained optimization problems, with an emphasis on maintaining the efficiency and convergence guarantees of the original unconstrained optimization approaches.
